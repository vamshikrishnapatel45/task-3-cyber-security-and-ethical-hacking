Objective

To explore and secure web applications by identifying and exploiting OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in a controlled lab setup using DVWA on Kali Linux.

🧠 Key Implementations

SQL Injection (SQLi): Extracted credentials and implemented Prepared Statement-based mitigation.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Executed stored and reflected XSS attacks; applied CSP and input validation fixes.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Demonstrated password-change attacks and token-based prevention.

File Inclusion Attacks: Tested LFI & RFI vulnerabilities to understand file access and remote code execution.

Burp Suite Advanced: Intercepted requests, modified login parameters, and performed fuzzing using Intruder.

Web Security Headers: Used securityheaders.com for analysis and enhanced security via Apache configurations.

🧾 Deliverables
